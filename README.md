# SPACE

Contracts for Unicial(Universe Social) space.

## Overview

The SPACE contract keeps a record of all the space parcels, who their owner is,
and what data is associated with them. The data associated can be an IPFS
identifier, an IPNS url, or a simple HTTPS endpoint with a space description
file.

Every parcel in Unicial's world is represented by a NFT(non-fungible token ERC#721) that is unique.

This SPACE token is the most important digital asset in Unicial. The Unicial is divided into square parcels
of SPACE.

The SPACE token exists on a EVM blockchain (currently Zilionixx).
